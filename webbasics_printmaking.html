                    a show featuring work by Georgia Carbone and Stella Lowery. Georgia's prints have a unique layered appearance
                    that gives the effect of a collaged artwork. Georgia explained how she created this effect. </p>
                    <p id = "printmaking-process">Georgia describes her process stating that she would roll ink on to a monotype plate. She would then cut thin
                    shapes from sheets of acetate. Using the monotype plate, she would make a print onto the acetate, transferring the
                    color on to the sheets. Finally, she used the acetate sheets and printed those on a piece of paper, resulting in the collaged
                    appearance of her work.
