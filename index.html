                    <p id="about-artist">This is the website for Georgia Carbone. Georgia is an artist based in New York City.
                    She has studied art throughout high school and college and explores a variety of mediums in her artwork. This website 
                    discusses her practice and her vivid and creative artworks that she creates in the form of paintings, prints, drawings, 
                    and jewelry. On this website you can find more information about Georgia's practices as an artist and what influences 
                    and inspires her. You can learn about her printmaking process and an exhibition that featured her prints. This 
                    website also includes links to Georgia's social media accounts where she shares her art. One of them is exclusively for 
                    her handmade jewelry which she constructs using beads from secondhand jewelry. Georgia was interviewed and provided the 
                    information on this website, as well as a resume to showcase her prior experience.</p>
